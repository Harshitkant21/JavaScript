# JavaScript Deep Dive 🚀

Welcome to my personal JavaScript learning repository — a part of my #BuildingWithHarshit journey.

This repo contains hands-on examples, detailed notes, and well-documented code that break down how JavaScript works under the hood.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (So Far)

### 🔹 Day 1 – Execution Context & Code Flow
- How JavaScript creates the Global Execution Context
- Memory Allocation Phase vs Code Execution Phase
- Function Execution Contexts
- Call Stack & its role in managing execution
- Detailed comments inside `execution-context.js`

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

As a developer, understanding the *internals* of JavaScript gives you real power — better debugging skills, deeper clarity, and stronger confidence.

I'm using this repo to:
- Document my learning from resources like **Namaste JavaScript (by Akshay Saini)**
- Create examples that reinforce the concepts
- Share my journey publicly to stay consistent and help others
